# Odin Diary

Not a lot of styling here and that’s intentional. I didn’t want to waste 3–5 hours figuring out if a `<div>` is 3 pixels off-center. This project wasn’t about CSS. It was about **JavaScript**, **modular structure**, and working with **APIs and async/await**.

---

## What I Focused On:

- Clean, modular JS (files like `gifAPI.js` and `weatherAPI.js`)
- Using **async/await** to fetch data
- Working with real APIs
- Structuring code in a more readable and maintainable way

---

## What I Learned:

I learned a lot in this project surprisingly...

- I got better at **breaking logic into separate files**, keeping all weather logic in `weatherAPI.js`.
- If I did this again, I’d probably **only fetch data** inside those files and move display logic elsewhere (maybe into a `display.js` or `app.js`).
- But honestly Im pretty proud of how much I've grown from the todo list (I struggled on the module side of code) to this project

And if you’re thinking:

> "But Markus it's literally been only one project and this project was a lot easier than the Todo project"

**Yeah shut up -\_-** Let me have this W

## Reflection:

Yeah this project was easier than the To-Do List... but I actually learned more.

"Why Markus?" Lemme tell you, you little Baka... Because I I made in previous projects. That kind of growth matters.
I still learned a lot in this project even though it was easier yes the Todo app was harder but that's why I REALIZED I learned a lot in this project because **I caught myself before making mistakes** that I would've done / did in the todo App that I didn't do them here and Im counting that as a W... so :P!
